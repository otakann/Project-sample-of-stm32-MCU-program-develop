# Project Sample of stm32 MCU program develop

## What is this
Step to show how to use free tools to code , build and debug stm32 MCU program.

## Environment
* [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
* [Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/)
* [gcc-arm-none-eabi](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads)
* [openocd](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/openocd/releases)

## SDK
* [STM32Cube MCU Package](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32-32-bit-arm-cortex-mcus.html#tools-software)
* [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/a00104.html)

## Evaluation board
* [B-L475E-IOT01A](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-l475e-iot01a.html)

## Example
Blink user led

## Manual
* Download the gcc-arm-none-eabi toolchain from [ARM official website](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads). Unpack it to wherever you want. In this case I put it in "/usr/local/install".
* Run "arm-none-eabi-gcc -v" to test if the toolchain can be executed. If the location you installed is not in the system path, you may add the full 
absolute path before the executable file. In this case I run "/usr/local/install/gcc-arm-none-eabi-8-2018-q4-major/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc -v". 
* Download the Open On-Chip Debugger binary packages from [GNU MCU Eclipse Project](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/openocd/releases). Unpack it to wherever you want. In this case I put it in "/usr/local/install".
* Copy the "60-openocd.rules" file in "contrib" folder to "/etc/udev/rules.d/" directory. In this case I run "sudo cp /usr/local/install/gnu-mcu-eclipse/openocd/0.10.0-11-20190118-1134/contrib/60-openocd.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/"
